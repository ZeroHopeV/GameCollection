## General Info and description

This project is mainly a collection of games that I made that everyone can play. People can create a user to store their score and progress in the database.

### Usage and config

If you want to take a deeper look at the code itself and test stuff out, you will need the database and all the relevant files. You can expand by using a server of your preference to host locally, note that the project uses MariaDB/MySQL and PHP/PDO.

Do watch out for complex problems that are likely to occur, for example:
+ Database User Privileges (Create new DB-user with all privileges)
+ IP-Domain Hosting (Configure correct IP-Domain)
+ Session-Cookie-Domain Configuration (Configure php.ini file, depending on your server)

Take a look at the Wiki (GitHub Wiki) for examples of commands for installing Apache, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB and Git for Linux Ubuntu Server/Desktop starting setup if you need them.
