## General Info and description

This project is mainly a collection of games that I made that everyone can play. People can create a user to store their score and progress in the database.

### Usage and config

If you want to take a deeper look at the code itself and test stuff out, you will need the database and all the relevant files. You can expand by using a server of your preference to host locally, note that the project uses MariaDB/MySQL and PHP/PDO.
