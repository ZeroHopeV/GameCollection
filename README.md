## General Info and description

This project is mainly a collection of games that I made that everyone can play. People can create a user to store their score and progress in the database.

### Usage and config

If you want to take a deeper look at the code itself and test stuff out, you will need the database and all the files except for documentation. Remember to watch out for problems with filepath. Make sure to figure out if you are going to use localhost or a server and change some bits of code accordingly, which are conn.php, session.php, and some JS files for the game.
